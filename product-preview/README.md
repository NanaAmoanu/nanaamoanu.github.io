## Overview
It is my first challenge and it has been an amazing way to spend some of my time.

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- media query


### What I learned

- First time of using flexbox and I learned a lot
- Using media query to create responsive pages


```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 700px) {
  /* All codes necessary for mobile view with a maximum width of 700px goes in here*/
}



### Useful resources
