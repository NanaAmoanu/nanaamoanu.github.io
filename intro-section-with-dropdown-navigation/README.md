## Overview
  The task was to built a basic hero section using html, css and javascript.It should be able to support various device sizes. It should be very interactive with a mobile menu as well.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [jquery ui](https://jqueryui.com)

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the css property "position".
I learnt how to build menus that appear and disapear based on certain events such as hover, click, etc.
I learnt how to use various toggle options provided by jquery for adding effects to the web and in building customs menus for mobile sized devices.


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  position: fixed;
}
```
```js

  $("").css("opacity");

```
### Continued development

There are lot of html tags, elements, css attributes as well as js codes. Working on more projects serves as a way of grasping the concepts well.
I had to learn how to use the css position property to make certain features work. I hope to get more assignemts that challenges me to make more use of that property.
