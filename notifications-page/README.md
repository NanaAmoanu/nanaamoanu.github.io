## Overview
  The task was to built a basic notifications page using html, css. Use javascript to toggle notification states. It should be able to support various device sizes.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [jquery ui](https://jqueryui.com)

### What I learned

I learnt how to changes css styles using javascript and also manipulate html using javascript


```js

  $("").html("");
  $("").css('','');

```
### Continued development

There are lot of html tags, elements, css attributes as well as js codes. Working on more projects serves as a way of grasping the concepts well.
I would like to do more with flex box and know the various options available. Adding more js to the codes to make the web pages more responsive. Areas like email phone number validations, password confirmations etc.
